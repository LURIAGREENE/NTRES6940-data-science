## Readings

<br>

#### Required: 

* [Chapter 3: Data types and objects](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/data-types-and-objects.html) in Modern R with the tidyverse by Bruno Rodrigues

<br>

* Chapters [10](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html),  [11](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html), [14.1 + 14.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#introduction-8), [15.1 + 15.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) and [16](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) in R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund [That sounds like a lot, but all the sections are pretty short and contain important information. Chapters 10 and 11 are the most essential if you don't have time to read them all]

<br>
